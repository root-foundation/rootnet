**incentivize collaboration in life.**

---

a personal token represents the value a person creates over their life (grounded in realized capital gains).

**collaborate** — by sharing equity in our personal token, we incentivize collaboration at the level of life - beyond any single idea, including phases _before_ concrete ideas.

**control** — shareholding represents participation, not control over decisions or direction. token owners control who may hold shares and can buy back equity.
