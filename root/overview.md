a personal token represents the value a person creates over their life.

its value is grounded in its owner’s realized capital gains from equity in companies, personal tokens, and similar instruments. it is expected to be treated as a security.

by sharing equity in personal tokens, we can incentivize collaboration at the level of life: beyond any single idea or venture, including periods before concrete ideas exist.

shareholding represents participation, not control over decisions or direction. token owners decide who may hold shares and can buy back equity.

as our work becomes more creative, producing more uncertain and extreme outcomes, we will need to share risk earlier and more broadly.
