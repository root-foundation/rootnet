we can incentivize help for ideas by sharing equity in companies.

but we don’t have a way to incentivize help for exploration, learning, or life itself.

as a result, many worthwhile explorations never begin or receive the help they need.

a personal token represents the value a person creates over their life.

its value is grounded in its owner’s realized capital gains from equity in companies, personal tokens, and similar instruments.

by sharing equity in personal tokens, we incentivize collaboration at the level of life: beyond any single idea (including periods *before* concrete ideas exist).

shareholding represents participation, not control over decisions or direction. token owners control who may hold shares and can buy back equity.

as work becomes more creative - producing more uncertain and extreme outcomes - personal tokens enable us to incentivize the help our work will increasingly demand.
