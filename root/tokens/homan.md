rootnet is my life's work.

and i need help - a lot of it - to realize its potential.

this page represents my personal token - an instrument that lets me share the value I create over my life, grounded in the equity I earn across companies, personal tokens, network tokens, and future instruments we haven’t invented yet.

i want to share equity in my token to incentivize help in my life - so that, together, we can realize rootnet’s potential.

i want a village behind me.

my token's cap table is sacred. those who hold equity in my token are those who believed in me when few others would. who are helping me realize my potential. angels.

this is why access to my cap table isn't open for anyone to buy their way onto without my permission. think of this like an early stage startup, but more personal.

you don't need to contribute capital to get onto my cap table. anyone who can meaningfully impact my success deserves to be there.

there are many ways you can help. some don't even require time (signal).

disclosure: i hold no equity in any asset (companies or otherwise). when i do earn equity, i plan to do so onchain - to maximize transparency, enable real-time shareholder voting, and distribute dividends programmatically.
