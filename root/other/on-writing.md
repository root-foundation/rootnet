title: on writing
---

there are 3 primary flavors of writing:
1. primitive specs
2. implementation docs
3. story

we should keep these writings separate because they serve different purposes.

## specs

specs describe what we want to create that we believe reflects what the world actually wants.

specs should not take into consideration present constraints of the world. they should be written with a free mind. when writing specs, think that you can mold the world to exactly what you want.

specs should be clear, concise, simple, timeless. 

use language that can be understood centuries from now. try to avoid words with cultural baggage.

assume smart, open-minded curious reader with the desire to see this instrument work.

exercise restraint. allow the reader to form their own deductions. invite the reader to think *with* you.

specs should be short. no more than 1k words. ideally less than 500.

avoid "I", "My", "We", etc. stick to just stating the facts of the thing you're trying to describe.

do not try to persuade or generate enthusiasm.

do not defend anything. the point of a spec is to share what we want to create. that's it. the "why" and "how" exist elsewhere.

the doc should stand on its own. it should feel greater than any individual. authorship is useful to give people a way to reach you, but it should not be placed prominently or near the title. keep your name with link to reach you towards the end. always link to rootnet above yourself. the idea is greater than any of us.


## implementation docs

the "how" we will implement specs.

these docs take into account present constraints of the world.


## stories

the "why". the thinking and feeling that underpins bringing something to the world that is useful to make sense of the instrument from an emotional, intellectual perspective.
