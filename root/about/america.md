title: "change starts at home"
---
rootnet requires the support of our legal, regulatory and political systems. this is not an idea that can be built in isolation. that's why we can't launch to the world on day one. we will start at home - in america.

our country is more divided than ever before as a consequence of perverse incentives. rootnet will enables better incentives that will [unite](/unity-incentives) our country. 

changing the world starts at home. 
with rootnet, we can make our country great.
