## our world is polarized

our world is extreme. polarized. fragmented. we see extreme poles in everything: political ideologies, social platforms, economic policies, cultures.

i believe this polarization largely stems from the tension between the individual and the collective. 

on one hand we want to enable individual freedom and brilliance. we want the best to have access to resources so that they can do great work that will positively impact all of us. it hurts us when great potential isn't given the resources it needs to blossom.

on the other hand, we want to make sure that everyone prospers. it hurts all of us when we see individual success that was enabled by the entire system that everyone contributes to, but very little flowing back everyone - to the collective.

we are pushed to pick a side. right vs. left. individualism vs. collectivism. capitalism vs. communism. X vs. tiktok/ig.

## but the axis itself is a lie

but even choosing the middle ground is to acknowledge that individual and collective success are somehow at odds. that to help one we need to take from the other - through taxes, freedoms, etc. that our world is a zero-sum game.

but this axis itself is a lie because there is no trade-off between the individual and collective success in reality.

## we are a single organism

we cannot separate the individual from the collective. we are all part of the same organism.

every single idea we work on is built on top of millions of others. every expression enables exponentially more expressions. where is the notion of individual achievement in our world? it's not even possible. from the language i'm writing in, to the tools i'm using, to the internet you're receiving this through, to the many works of art that have shaped me, what am i but a reflection of the collective organism? how separate are we really?

we should want more great explorations, ideas, and discoveries! it benefits all of us. from penicillin to the internet to democracy to everything that we value involved individual brilliance. and we want to enable more people to have them by giving everyone access to an abundance of resources.

in reality there is no conflict between the individual and the collective. we are in this together. but we've created this conflict because our systems do not reflect that we are a single organism.

what if we reflected this truth in our systems?
