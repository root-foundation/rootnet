## our world is polarized

our world is extreme. polarized. fragmented. we see polarization everywhere: political ideologies, social platforms, economic policies, cultures.

on one hand we want individual brilliance to shine because we know that benefits all of us. it hurts when great potential isn't given the resources it needs to blossom.

on the other hand, we see that success requires help from everyone, and so it hurts when everyone isn't compensated fairly for their role and are left to wither away.

we are pushed to pick a side. right vs. left. individualism vs. collectivism. capitalism vs. communism. X vs. tiktok/ig.

## but the axis itself is a lie

but even choosing the middle ground is to acknowledge that individual and collective success are somehow at odds. that to help the collective we need to take from the individual - through capital (taxes), freedom, and power. that our world is a zero-sum game.

but this axis itself is a lie because there is no trade-off between the individual and collective success.

## we are a single organism

we cannot separate the individual from the collective. we are all part of the same organism.

every single idea we work on is built on top of millions of others. every expression enables exponentially more expressions. where is the notion of individual achievement in our world? from the language i'm writing in, to the tools i'm using, to the internet you're receiving this through, to the many works of art that have shaped me, what am i but a reflection of the collective organism? how separate are we really?

we want more great explorations, ideas, and discoveries! it benefits all of us. from penicillin to the internet to democracy to everything that we value involved individual brilliance. and we also want to democratize opportunity so that everyone can shine - by giving everyone access to an abundance of resources.

these desires are not at odds because we are in this together.

but we've created this conflict because our systems don't reflect that we are in this together. our financial, political, social systems all pit the individual against the collective. 

what if we reflected the truth in our systems?
