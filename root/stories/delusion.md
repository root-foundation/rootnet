## i feel like i don't belong

our world is extreme. polarized. fragmented. we see extreme poles in everything: political ideologies, social platforms, economic policies, cultures.

i believe this polarization largely stems from the tension between the individual and the collective. 

on one hand we want to enable individual freedom and brilliance. we want the best to have access to resources so that they can do great work that will positively impact all of us. it hurts us when great potential isn't given the resources it needs to blossom.

on the other hand, we want to make sure that everyone prospers. it hurts all of us when we see individual success that was enabled by the entire system that everyone contributes to, but very little flowing back everyone - to the collective.

we are pushed to pick a side. right vs. left. individualism vs. collectivism. capitalism vs. communism. X vs. tiktok/ig.

i feel like i don't belong on either side. nor do i belong in the middle because even the middle is operating on the same axis: that supporting one comes at the cost of the other - as if our world is a zero sum game. it is not.

i want both. i do not want to add any friction to individuals to shine and i want all of us to rise...

## we are a single organism

we cannot separate the individual from the collective. we are all part of the same organism.

every single idea we work on is built on top of millions of others. every expression enables exponentially more expressions. where is the notion of individual achievement in our world? it's not even possible. from the language i'm writing in, to the tools i'm using, to the internet you're receiving this through, to the many works of art that have shaped me, what am i but a reflection of the collective organism? how separate are we really?

we should want more great explorations, ideas, and discoveries! it benefits all of us. from penicillin to the internet to democracy to everything that we value involved individual brilliance. and we want to enable more people to have them by giving everyone access to an abundance of resources.

in reality there is no conflict between the individual and the collective. we are in this together. but we've created this conflict because our systems do not reflect that we are a single organism.

let's design a financial system that is aligned with reality...
