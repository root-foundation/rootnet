## our markets don't reflect what we value

not even a sliver of who and what we actually value (and the degree to which we do) is reflected in our economic markets today.

most of us fear global warming, but our markets continue to incentivize burning fossil fuels at the cost of our collective destruction.

most of us value great parenting, but our economic system forces many parents to work multiple jobs to support their families - forcing them to largely neglect their children.

we certainly value children over old people (it is human nature, and also practically because children will create far more value for our world than old people), and yet our economic system reflects the opposite: wealth and power hoarded by the old, leaving little for the young.

we value having kids, but we make it nearly financially impossible for most people to have kids. and we wonder why populations are collapsing.

we value great teachers, but we don't pay them nearly what they are worth, leading many of our greatest minds to do other things.

we need to fix our markets to better reflect what we actually value, to the degree that we do.

otherwise we cannot allocate resources to what we actually want to.

**otherwise we cannot incentivize what we actually want.**

## fixing our markets

through personal tokens, network tokens, and humanity's token, we can better represent what we actually value.

humanity's token value represents all of the future value we will create. it will be the instrument with the furthest time horizon - projecting decades into the future (and increasing as we become more confident in this system and ourselves).

this means that any action that jeopardizes our future will come at a great economic cost. it will cause humanity's token's value to collapse, sharply reducing the wealth in all of our hands.

in such a world, we would not allow actions like burning fossil fuels because it destroys so so much collective wealth immediately.

we could have a world in which parents automatically get shares in their childrens' personal tokens. this allows parents to raise venture capital to raise their children well. this allows parents to incentivize help to raise their children. people who truly want to build and nurture beautiful families can spend all of their time doing so without having to do things they genuinely don't care about in order to support their families.

we could have a world in which people are strongly incentivized to have children. we could issue new shares in humanity's token to any newborn. this would dilute everyone, but would give families more wealth. the more children you have, the more wealth your family gains.

personal token valuations of children will naturally be far greater than oldies because they have a lifetime ahead of them. this allows far more wealth to flow to the young. and with wealth comes power. i want to see a world run by the young, not outdated grandpas who should just be chillin.

we could have a world in which teachers invest in students' personal tokens instead of charging money to teach. great teachers would become some of the wealthiest people in our world (as they should!). this would attract incredible minds to teach because they finally get compensated fairly. this would weed out bad teachers and greatly improve the average quality of education.

the more we continue to securitize our world and become more familiar with these instruments, the better our markets will reflect what we actually value.

and the better our markets price what we actually value, economic growth & actual wellbeing and prosperity become more aligned.
