title: ai & extreme outcomes
---

## artificial intelligence

i view artificial intelligence as the ultimate tool that enables us to express ourselves better.

as ai improves, we will naturally gravitate towards more creative and complex work - across the board.

i believe we're designed to create. it's quite unnatural for us to do repetitive work. therefore, ai enables us to be more human.

## extreme outcomes

but the more creative and complex our work becomes, the more extreme outcomes we will see across our economy:

at any given moment, a tiny (and shrinking) percentage of people, companies, networks, etc. will be responsible for the majority of value created. (i.e, power law distribution of outcomes).

creative, complex work and extreme outcomes go hand in hand. we can't have one without the other. we already see extreme outcomes in our world today in highly creative, complex work (startups, content creation, arts, science, etc.).

what will be new is extreme outcomes across the board - because ai will do the simpler work across the board. ai does not distinguish between domains and labels like we do. all it cares about complexity.

extreme outcomes just represents what most of us intuitively know: for any creative activity, there exist people that are just way better than the rest.

**extreme outcomes is natural.**

## dynamism

extreme outcomes on its own paints a sort of dystopian picture.

if ai makes outcomes more extreme, will that lead to a world with like... 10 people who create all the value and no one else can?

absolutely not.

we fail to see what extreme outcomes means without also seeing _dynamism_:

firstly, the peak outcome rises. the most valuable companies today are worth much more than the most value companies a few decades ago. we will see the peak outcome skyrocket much faster than ever before. what this means is that even smaller wins feel much bigger in the same way that today a millionaire can afford a lot even though their share relative to the richest person has fallen. we will have many more "winners".

secondly, the rate of displacement increases because ai accelerates the rate of change of our world. for example, all the top companies today are more fragile than ever before because of a breakthrough that fundamentally changed the world, that they can't adapt well to. as such breakthroughs from unpredictable areas increasingly shake our world up, existing winners will find it very difficult to hold onto their positions.

similarly, when a new breakthrough occurs somewhere, we will push resources very rapidly to incredible ideas that such breakthrough has enabled.

this is what a _dynamic_ world with extreme outcomes looks like. i believe we will see a world in which ideas will generate trillions in revenue days after being launched, and become outcompeted within months because of some random breakthrough elsewhere that invalidated their approach entirely.

it is a world in which we react to a rapidly changing reality blazingly fast.

such dynamism is key for our progress.

and with the right financial system, such a world benefits all of us.

extreme outcomes _without_ dynamism points at a rotten system: unfairness. oppression. favoritism. political influence. we should be very suspicious when we see stagnation in the system.

stagnation is unnatural.
