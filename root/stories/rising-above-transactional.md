title: rising above transactional value creation
---

let's say there is a young person who has a naturally gifted mind towards science.

by following her natural curiosities she discovers something profound about nature that promises to solve global warming (or some other massive global challenge)...

if we believe she has even a sliver of a shot of discovering something that will solve global warming, we will value her personal token astronomically.

she may never even invest in other personal tokens or companies or anything. she may never have capital gains, but her efforts will directly amplify the value of humanity's token - i.e, her efforts would greatly increase the wealth in all of our hands.

and thus we would value her token greatly.

and her tokens' valuation is grounded in truth - just not directly (via capital gains) - but on our belief in her potential to impact humanity's token's valuation.

in this way, eventually, i believe people will not even have to worry about "transactions". 

artists will not have to worry about ticket sales - they can focus purely on surfacing the truth to our collective consciousness that raises the value of humanity's token. scientists can explore nature without worrying about begging for money from some government authority to support them. we will support them. the market will. because we value their work (i.e, we think it will positively impact humanity's token's value - increasing all of our wealth).

and importantly, even this is grounded in reality. if we value this scientist greatly, but she doesn't end up discovering anything for a while and we lose hope that she will impact humanity's token's value positively, we will value her token less. 

her impact on humanity's token is the grounding in reality.
