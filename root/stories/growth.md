## cancerous growth

the more we can't represent what we actually value, the more that economic growth is cancerous growth.

from destroying our environment, to mediocre education, to slop, to ads, to insanity, to growth in everything we all hate but "deal with" because we think it's some sort of necessity.

cancerous growth is a consequence of our markets not pricing what we actually value.

## right growth

free markets + reflecting what we actually value = right growth.

the better our markets represent what we actually value, the better it is to optimize for economic growth.

with this system, growth becomes the right sort of growth: growth in knowledge, supporting each other, art, beauty, science, technology, sanity, etc.
