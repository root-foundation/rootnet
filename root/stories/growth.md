## cancerous growth

the more we can't represent what we actually value, the more that economic growth is cancerous growth:

growth in ads, slop, destroying our world, insanity, etc.

cancerous growth is a consequence of our markets not pricing what we actually value.

## right growth

free markets + reflecting what we actually value = right growth.

the better our markets represent what we actually value, the better it is to optimize for economic growth.

growth in knowledge, helping each other, art, beauty, science, technology, sanity, etc.

## we must grow

right growth ensures that no individual will gain too much power over others.

as we grow, belief in humanity’s future grows, which raises the value of humanity’s token and reduces the relative power of any single individual.

if we stagnate, our belief in humanity's future shrinks, which increases the relative power of high value individuals.

nature reminds us to grow. in nature, there is only accelerating growth or accelerating decay.

as we continue to fix our markets with better instruments, growth will reward us.

we must choose growth.
