## cancerous growth

the more we can't represent what we actually value, the more that economic growth is cancerous growth.

from destroying our environment, to mediocre education, to slop, to ads, to insanity, to growth in everything we all hate but "deal with" because we think it's some sort of necessity.

cancerous growth is a consequence of our markets not pricing what we actually value.

## right growth

free markets + reflecting what we actually value = right growth.

the better our markets represent what we actually value, the better it is to optimize for economic growth.

with this system, growth becomes the right sort of growth: growth in knowledge, supporting each other, art, beauty, science, technology, sanity, etc.

## we must grow

right growth ensures that no individual will gain too much power over others.

the more we believe that we will create more value in the future, the less power the most valuable individuals have - because their token's valuations will be much smaller relative to the humanity token's valuation (which represents the potential of our species itself, that all of us will hold equity in).

which means if we stop growing and we lo se hope in the future, the more power in the hands of the high value people as they will have more resources and power they can allocate, relative to the rest of us.

nature also teaches us to grow. in nature, there is only accelerating growth or accelerating decay. 

we must choose growth.
