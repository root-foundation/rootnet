title: ai will never replace us
---

because most of us spend our lives translating others' ideas into reality, or deriving from others' great ideas, we sorely underestimate the sort of skill required to discover great, original ideas.

we underestimate it by many many many orders of magnitude. 

this is partly why i think there is such a polarized reaction to ai. the most skilled in the world can't get enough of ai, and the least skilled are naturally terrified by it and therefore see a dystopian future painted by their ignorance of the depth of human capacity.

ai will never grow close to the capabilities of the most skilled humans.

when i first had this intuition i doubted it. this belief felt very similar to the various other delusions that stem from our ego (like the delusion that earth is center of universe, etc.). but i can't seem to shake this belief perhaps because i see the human potential as nature's potential itself. that we are one and the same. and i don't believe our creations can surpass nature. (but isn't a dog part of nature as well? but ai can outcompete dogs in creating value right? the difference is access to the nature within us. and i believe humans have full access if we train ourselves).

therefore, for now, i do not accept a possibility of a future in which we are irrelevant. i will only accept such a possibility if we ever witness a situation in which none of us can come up with a great idea that ai hasn't already discovered.
