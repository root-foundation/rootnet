title: fixing our education system
---

we need a systemic change at the level of incentives.

we need a system that puts the burden of risk on the teacher, NOT the student.

we need a system that ensures that teachers optimize for the long-term success of students.

we need a system that weeds out the many many bad teachers in our world today. they should not be given a chance to pollute our most valuable minds.

we need a system that rewards teachers for doing one of the world's most valuable things. the best teachers should be extremely wealthy, so that many more of our greatest minds will choose to teach.

we need an education system based on teachers investing in students' personal tokens.

teachers should pay students to teach them in exchange for equity in their success (personal tokens).

bad teachers would go broke fast (and i pray they will).

great teachers should be able to raise massive funds to amplify their teaching to the world. because now the wider you can reach, the more great students you can attract to invest in. these incentives reward open-ness and not hiding knowledge from the world.

i want every teacher across every skill to operate the way paul graham did. paul graham was one of the first examples of this model of teaching. he taught the art of startups from his heart with the genuine desire to help others experience what he did. he didn't put his knowledge behind a stupid paywall. he could spread it wide and far because he was monetizing his impact in a much much more powerful way - by investing in the best of the people he reached with his knowledge.

but because we don't have personal tokens, paul grahams can only exist in the world of startups.

an education system built on investing in students' personal tokens also gives students powerful information about how good a teacher actually is. 

people can study the investments teachers have made and how they worked out. teachers can't fake being great for long - they will be exposed sooner or later by the truth (which they can no longer hide).

an education system based on investing in students' personal tokens is far better grounded in reality. the more teachers, the more capital invested, the more students, the better the system becomes at representing the truth about who's actually good at teaching and who's not.
