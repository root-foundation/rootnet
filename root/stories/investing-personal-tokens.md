title: investing in personal tokens

## investing is about helping, not owing

first, we need to clarify what investing means. 

in the context of personal tokens, investing means helping that person realize their potential. investing is not about owning or influencing someone against their wishes. this is represented in the personal token mechanics.

a personal token owner can allow shareholders who no longer have potential to help get diluted. they can also kick out toxic shareholders. only those who are genuinely helpful can get onto personal token cap tables and rise to the top.

investing is not just about capital. there are many ways to help and earn equity in a person's token. by collaborating, amplifying signal, capital, and many ways that we can't even describe now.

## demonstrate impact

holding equity in personal tokens demonstrates your impact on others. it shows the world your ability to help others succeed - in an irrefutable way.

## greater upside

firstly, we saw how personal tokens capture potential **across** all of the ideas that a person will get involved with over their lives. personal tokens will be worth much more than the sum of a person's holdings - especially if they are young and have more years ahead of them.

as ai gets more powerful, each of us will get involved with (i.e, hold equity in) many more ideas over the course of our lives. as we work on more ideas, we will increasingly want to invest in the **source** of those ideas: people. and as our attention shifts towards people, that is also where value will become concentrated.

we've already seen this trend with companies. in the early days, the gap between a company's valuation and its profits was slim. but over time, as our world became safer and more stable, and as we became more familiar with companies, **we became more confident in betting on potential**. and thus the gap between a company's valuation and profits has grown sharply. i predict the same will happen with personal tokens.

## more natural than investing in companies

even when we invest in companies, especially early stage, we mostly think about the people because better minds will outcompete mediocre ones sooner or later.

**personal tokens enables us to express our belief in people much more directly.** - and even before they may start or work on an idea.

## safer bet

even great minds will fail at many ideas before they succeed. especially if they are ambitious. investing in their token is a far safer bet than investing in any specific idea they have.

## we will all become investors

not because we will all learn to do something new, but because personal tokens will evolve the notion of investing to something much more broad and natural: helping others realize their potentials.

and so it's not that we all "become" investors, but that personal tokens expand "investing" to capture what we naturally do.
