we can't incentivize help on explorations, and life itself, in the way we can for ideas (through companies). as a result, we can't explore as boldly and freely as we wish to. many people, and *all* of us, lose out.

we need an instrument that enables us to share a piece of our success with others, that represents the value we will create through our lives, so that we can incentivize a profound kind of help and support that we can't today.

## sharing success

let's design an instrument that lets me share my success with others, so that i can incentivize help on my exploration, in my journey, in my life itself.

firstly, what do i mean by "success"? in the honest sense, success is an emotion, but i need something more tangible to work with. so let's define success as the wealth i will create over the course of my life.

and let's narrow it to the kind of wealth that is most valuable in our world - the kind of wealth that comes from things that grow in extreme ways: companies.

my token represents the equities i will hold in companies. and my token needs shares (like companies) so that i can share my success with others.

## permissionless

but i can’t expose my future equity to my token shareholders - that would require permission from future cofounders and would get legally messy.

so my token must be grounded in _capital gains_, not equity directly. this lets me share my upside with others without needing anyone’s permission.

we can implement this grounding through dividends: capital gains from selling equity in a company is routed to shareholders proportional to the equity they hold.

## does not confine

importantly, my token doesn't confine me to any particular path in life. perhaps i decide i want to join a great startup instead of starting one myself. or maybe i decide to just invest in companies. since my token is grounded in capital gains, it doesn't matter _how_ i earn equity in companies, just that i do.

## captures potential

the gap between a company’s valuation and its profits reflects how we value its _potential_ to create profits (reality).

the same logic applies to personal tokens. i hold no equity in any company. i have barely any money. thus, in our current economic system, i am worthless.

but my personal token enables the world to express how it feels about my _potential_ to create value. even if there is one person in the world who believes i will create value in the future and invests in me, my personal token valuation would not be zero.

as ai accelerates and enables each of us to get involved with many more ideas over the course of our lives, the gap between a personal token's valuation and reality will skyrocket because it reflects the truth that a person will do far more in the future than they've already done.

let's see another example to see just how profound this is. let's take someone like aravind srinivas (perplexity). the value of his holdings in companies might total to ~$10B. but that doesn't capture the dozens or hundreds or thousands of ideas he'll get involved with in the coming decades (investing and otherwise). if he had a personal token, i think it would be valued in the hundreds of billions _at least_.

## incentivize help in life

my personal token enables me to incentivize help in life itself, independent of any specific idea i work on. this lets me incentivize help _before_ i discover an important idea i want to commit to, but more importantly it means i can incentivize help _independent_ of ideas.

sharing equity personal token is a much more powerful incentive than sharing equity in a specific company i start because my token represents _all the value i will ever create_.

this enables a profound collaboration that does not exist in our world today.

## a) collaboration

sharing equity is the best way to attract the best people. we can see this in startups today.

with my personal token, i can now hire people to help me in my exploration / life by compensating them with equity in my holistic success, that i simply cannot hire today.

for example, i can hire a visual storyteller that would amplify all of my expressions - across all the ideas i'll ever get involved with - of a quality that i could not afford even if i had millions.

we cannot even imagine the sort of collaboration this enables in the same way that we could not imagine how companies would shape our world before we invented the "company".

## b) signal

investing in someone’s personal token is the most honest expression of belief in that person - it carries far more weight than likes, shares, or public praise.

great shareholders will open many doors through their mere presence on my personal token cap table.

## c) capital

and lastly, i can raise venture capital well before (and independent of) any specific idea to help me finance my exploration.

most founders will intuitively understand why i place this last. being able to work with the best people is far more valuable than capital, especially as we enter into a world of abundance.

and critically, this is not debt. i will not have to pay it back in case things don't work out.

## shareholding

in the same way that my token represents my _potential_ to create value, being a shareholder in my token represents _potential_ to _help_ me create value.

as long as a shareholder can help me create more value in the future, i will want them on my cap table, and incentivize them with equity proportional to how much i believe they will impact my life.

> note: there is no rigid expectation that a shareholder has to commit time or whatever. as we saw, i may want some shareholders purely for their signal, in which case it won't even matter if they spend any time, as long as their signal continues to open doors.

my cap table is sacred. when you are weird and unconventional, finding someone who believes in you is like finding a pool of water in a desert. it's one of the most beautiful feelings i've ever felt. my cap table represents such relationships. i will guard it.

## people are not companies

- key diff b/w company and person.
- help, not own.
- enable, not oppress

people are not companies. i would not use this instrument if it oppressed me in any way.

my token must protect my freedom, not harm me, and help me maximize my success (and thus my shareholders' success).

let's design for this.

my cap table is sacred. people shouldn’t be able to get on my cap table without my permission. 

## mechanics

let's design shareholding mechanics to reflect our principles.

---

### a) control

secondary sales can’t happen without my approval. i don’t want strangers buying their way into my life. similarly, i can’t imagine ever “ipo-ing” my token.

---

### b) issuing shares

i can issue new shares whenever i want, to bring new people on board.

this naturally dilutes existing shareholders, and that’s intentional. dilution is how my cap table adapts to reality over time.

there are no pro-rata rights. shareholders don’t have automatic entitlement to maintain their ownership. in most cases, i’ll happily let people buy more shares because i want to incentivize more help. but that choice must remain mine.

for example, let's say i feel that someone is no longer able to help me create value. i would prevent them from buying more shares, but their contribution is still reflected through their existing shares.

this lets equity reflect _actual, ongoing alignment and contribution_ - rising when someone can help, shrinking when they can’t.

---

### c) divorcing shareholders

relationships should be built on continuous choice, not force.

if someone becomes misaligned, harmful, or toxic, i retain the right to buy back their shares. this is not a normal mechanism - dilution is enough in almost all cases. buybacks exist only for extreme situations.

**my cap table is a living organism, it must be able to shed harmful cells to stay healthy.**

---

### d) scoped to upside

my token is scoped to _only_ my upside.

it is grounded in capital gains - not income, not wages, not assets. shareholders succeed only when i actually create real value in the world.

this means no debt, no obligations, no downside risk for me. if things don’t work out, i’m no worse off than if this token never existed. anyone who wants a claim on my income or control over my life isn’t the right person to partner with anyway.

## integrity

this puts a lot of control in the hands of the token owner. some may feel it's too much control.

but the long-term nature of this instrument helps prevent abuse through reputation.

**by being unfair in any way, i make it impossible to achieve my potential** - because i will spook existing shareholders and also future collaborators. 

what is fair is decided by everyone. if i do something i think is fair but the market thinks is not, i will naturally have to adapt, else i will no longer be able to incentivize the help i need.

this requires transparency. any edits made to my cap table will be public record. and i plan on being transparent about my thinking to give the world more information to determine how fair i am.

## support of a village

i need the help of a massive village to help me realize my potential.

i predict (and hope) that i will hold less than a percent of equity in my own token by the time i die because it would reflect that i was able to find great collaborators in life.

but, given how we've designed the personal token, i can't yet do this because right now diluting myself too much comes at the cost of my growth.

## growth & decay

i want to maximize my growth. the more help i can incentivize, the more i can grow.

at the same time, the more diluted i am, the less capital i have to fuel my growth (because i retain less of my capital gains). this bad for both my shareholders and myself. a lose-lose situation.

we need features to maximize growth.

**reinvesting dividends**: i will need to reinvest dividends such that on capital gains, all of it comes to my hands that i can spend to further fuel my growth.

**royalties**: similarly, to incentivize growth, i will need a royalty on secondary sales - every time a shareholder sells some of their shares (with my permission), i receive back a small percentage of those shares. the more i grow, the more equity i earn back in my token that i can share with others to help me grow even more.

but this lead to a problem. reinvesting dividends works in companies because there are natural liquidation events: acquisitions, ipo, etc. without a liquidation event for my personal token, reinvesting dividends disconnects it from reality.

which is why, at death i will have all of my holdings liquidated and all capital gains distributed to my shareholders. now, reinvesting dividends works.

and we have one more problem... reputation works to prevent abuse when i am young and have most of my growth ahead of me. but what happens when i am old and decaying? that version of me doesn't have an incentive to not abuse control because death is around the corner anyway. i could "reinvest dividends" into luxuries and not growth.

which means shareholders should be able to vote on one thing: whether dividends can be reinvested. if they believe i'm in decay, they will naturally vote against reinvesting. if i don't agree with them, i can try to replace them. but if the world believes i'm in decay, i will find no one to replace them with. i can't escape reality.

## overview

so we've designed an instrument that enables a person to share success in their lives, so that they can incentivize a profound sort of help and support in life itself - before, and independent of, any specific idea they work on.

and we've designed it in a way that preserves freedom, by putting most of the control in the hands of the individual so that they cannot be "owned", influenced in ways they don't want to be, or oppressed by others.

feel free to check out [my token](/homan) to see this instrument grounded in reality.

## legal

the personal token is fundamentally a legal instrument. yes, we will need to build products and services that represent and enable us to engage with this instrument, but without legal legitimacy, this instrument will not work.

there is still work to do to legally ground the personal token. consider helping.

current spec: [PERSONAL TOKEN v0.1](/PERSONAL_TOKEN).

## a world that supports explorations

with personal tokens, we can encourage bold explorations. the kind of explorations that would lead us to discover many great ideas. the kind of journeys that lead to profound breakthroughs.

we are incredibly oppressed. most of us cannot follow our natural curiosities because we cannot incentivize the support needed to follow them. our world is full of einsteins, curies, kurosawas that are confined to spending just a couple hours a day following their hearts and the rest of their lives doing work they're not meant to do in order to make ends meet.

this is such a massive loss to all of us that we will only realize in hindsight once we enable people to explore freely and witness the brilliance of their discoveries.

we cannot imagine how much potential we are squashing in our world today in the same way that we could not imagine the profound ideas that the notion of a "company" would enable us to work on.

the personal token is a new primitive. the building block for a new financial system that i believe will transform our world for the better.
