we can't incentivize help for explorations, and for life itself, in the way we can for ideas (through companies).

we need an instrument that enables us to share a piece of our success with others, that represents the value we will create through our lives, so that we can incentivize a profound kind of help and support for our explorations, for our lives.

let's craft such an instrument for myself, and then see how to generalize it.

## sharing success

i need to be able to share my success with others, so that i can incentivize help on my exploration, in my journey, in my life itself.

firstly, what do i mean by "success"? in the honest sense, success is an emotion, but i need something more tangible to work with. so let's define success as the wealth i will create over the course of my life.

and let's narrow it to the kind of wealth that is most valuable in our world - the kind of wealth that comes from things that grow in extreme ways: companies.

therefore, my personal "token" represents the equities i will hold in companies. and since i want to share pieces of it, let's give it shares (like a company).

## permissionless

but i can’t expose my future equity to my token shareholders - that would require permission from future cofounders and would get legally messy.

so my token must be grounded in _capital gains_, not equity directly. this lets me share my upside with others without needing anyone’s permission.

we can implement this grounding through dividends: capital gains from when i sell equity in a company is routed to my token shareholders proportional to the equity they hold in my token.

## does not confine

importantly, my token doesn't confine me to any particular path in life. 

perhaps i decide i want to join a great startup instead of starting one myself. or maybe i only go onto invest in companies.

since my token is grounded in capital gains, it doesn't matter _how_ i earn equity in companies, just that i do.

## captures potential

my token captures my potential to create value - that the world currently ignores.

the gap between a company’s valuation and its profits reflects how we value its _potential_ to create profits (reality).

the same logic applies to personal tokens. my personal token enables the world to express how it feels about my _potential_ to create value. even if there is one person in the world who believes i will create value in the future and invests in me, my personal token valuation would not be zero.

i hold no equity in any company. i have barely any money. in our current economic system, i am worthless. but my personal token reflects my potential that our current economic system ignores.

as ai accelerates and enables each of us to get involved with many more ideas over the course of our lives, the gap between a personal token's valuation and reality will skyrocket because it reflects the truth that a person will do far more in the future than they've already done.

let's see another example to see just how profound this is. let's take someone like aravind srinivas (perplexity). the value of his holdings in companies might total to ~$10B. but that doesn't capture the dozens or hundreds or thousands of ideas he'll get involved with in the coming decades (investing and otherwise). if he had a personal token, i think it would be valued in the hundreds of billions **at least**.

## incentivize help in life

my personal token enables me to incentivize help in life itself.

i can incentivize help **before** i discover an important idea i want to commit to, but more importantly it means i can incentivize help **independent** of ideas.

sharing equity my personal token is a powerful incentive because my token represents **all the value i will ever create**.

this enables a profound collaboration that does not exist in our world today.

## a) collaboration

sharing equity is the only way to attract the best minds to collaborate.

through my personal token, i can hire people to help me in my life by including equity in my token as part of their compensation.

for example, i can hire a visual storyteller that would amplify all of my expressions - across all the ideas i'll ever get involved with, of a quality that i would not afford even if i had millions.

## b) signal

investing in someone’s personal token is the most honest expression of belief in that person - it carries far more weight than likes, shares, public praise, or even investing in a company they start.

presence of great people on my token's cap table will open many doors.

## c) capital

and lastly, i can raise venture capital well before (and independent of) any specific idea.

importantly, this isn't debt. i can use this venture capital to hire and amplify my exploration and life.

> most founders will intuitively understand why i place this last. being able to work with the best people is far more valuable than capital, especially as we enter into a world of abundance.

## shareholding

in the same way that my token represents my **potential** to create value, being a shareholder in my token represents **potential to help** me create value.

as long as a shareholder can help me create more value in the future, i will want them on my cap table, and incentivize them with equity proportional to how much i believe they will impact my success over the course of my life.

> note: there is no rigid expectation that a shareholder has to commit time or whatever. as we saw, i may want some shareholders purely for their signal, in which case it won't even matter if they spend any time, as long as their signal continues to open doors. all that matters is: can they help me succeed...

**my cap table is sacred.**

my cap table represents the people who believe in me when others wouldn't.

anyone who's taken an unconventional path in life understands how precious the people who believe in you are.

my cap table represents something special to me. it is sacred. no one can simply buy their way onto my cap table without my permission.

## people are not companies

people are not companies. sharing equity in my token is about incentivizing help, not giving up ownership over my life.

**i would not use this instrument if it oppressed me in any way.**

my token must protect my freedom, not harm me, and help me maximize my success (and thus my shareholders' success).

let's design for this.

## mechanics

### a) control

secondary sales can’t happen without my approval. i don’t want strangers buying their way into my life. similarly, i can’t imagine ever “ipo-ing” my token.

---

### b) issuing shares

i can issue new shares whenever i want, to bring new people on board.

this naturally dilutes existing shareholders, and that’s intentional. dilution is how my cap table adapts to reality over time.

there are **no pro-rata rights**. shareholders don’t have automatic entitlement to maintain their ownership. in most cases, i’ll happily let people buy more shares because i want to incentivize more help. but that choice must remain mine.

if i feel that someone can no longer help me create value, i would prevent them from buying more shares. but their contribution in my life is still reflected through their existing shares.

this enables my cap table to reflect actual, ongoing alignment and contribution - rising when someone can help, shrinking when they can’t.

---

### c) divorcing shareholders

relationships should be built on continuous choice, not force.

if someone becomes misaligned, harmful, or toxic, i retain the right to buy back their shares. this is not a normal mechanism - dilution is enough in almost all cases. buybacks exist only for extreme situations.

**my cap table is a living organism, it must be able to shed harmful cells to stay healthy.**

---

### d) scoped to upside

my token is grounded in capital gains from companies - not income, wages, or other assets. 

which means shareholders succeed only when i create meaningful value in the world.

no debt, no obligations, no downside risk. if things don’t work out, i’m not in a hole i can't climb out of. besides, anyone who wants a claim on my income isn’t the right person to partner with anyway.

## integrity

this puts a lot of control in the hands of the token owner. some may feel it's too much control.

but the long-term nature of this instrument helps prevent abuse through reputation.

**by being unfair in any way, i make it impossible to achieve my potential** - because i will spook existing shareholders and also future collaborators. 

what is fair is decided by everyone. if i do something i think is fair but the market thinks is not, i will naturally have to adapt, else i will no longer be able to incentivize the help i need.

this requires transparency. any edits made to my cap table will be public record. and i plan on being transparent about my thinking behind all of my decisions about my token - so that the world has the information it needs to accurately determine how fair i am.

## support of a village

i need the help of a massive village to help me realize my potential.

i predict (and hope) that i will hold less than one percent of equity in my own token by the time i die because it would reflect that i was able to find great collaborators in life.

but, given how we've designed the personal token so far, i can't share equity with a village because over-dilution comes at the cost of my growth.

we need to fix this.

## growth & decay

i want to maximize my growth. the more help i can incentivize, the more i can grow.

but the more diluted i am, the less capital i will have to fuel my growth because i lose more of my capital gains through dividends to my shareholders. 

this bad for both my shareholders and myself. a lose-lose situation.

we need to add features that maximize growth.

---
### royalties

every time a shareholder sells some of their shares in my token, i receive back a small percentage of those shares. 

the more i grow, the more equity i earn back in my token that i can share with others to help me grow even more.

---
### reinvesting dividends

i will need to reinvest dividends into myself, to fuel my growth.

my capital gains won't be distributed to shareholders. shareholders will profit through secondary sales.

but this lead to a problem. reinvesting dividends works for companies because there are natural liquidation events: acquisition, ipo, etc. without a liquidation event for my personal token, reinvesting dividends disconnects my token's valuation from reality.

which is why, at death i will have all of my holdings liquidated and all capital gains distributed to my shareholders.

now, reinvesting dividends works. my token is still grounded in reality.

but we have another problem. reputation works to prevent abuse when i am young and have most of my growth ahead of me. but what happens when i am old and decaying? that version of me doesn't have an incentive to not abuse control because death is around the corner anyway. i could simply "reinvest dividends" into luxuries and not into my growth.

which means shareholders should be able to vote on one thing: whether dividends can be reinvested. if they believe i'm in decay, they will naturally vote against reinvesting. if i don't agree with them, i can try to replace them. but if the world believes i'm in decay, i will find no one to replace them with. i can't escape reality.

## overview

we've designed an instrument that enables a person to share success in their lives, so that they can incentivize a profound sort of help and support in life itself - before, and independent of, any specific idea they work on.

and critically, we've designed it in a way that preserves freedom - by putting most of the control in the hands of the individual so that they cannot be "owned", influenced in ways they don't want to be. that protects against oppression.

through personal tokens, individuals can incentivize profound help for their explorations, and more broadly, their lives.

check out [my token](/homan) to see this idea grounded in reality.

## legal

at its core, the personal token is a legal instrument. 

yes, we will need to build products and services that represent tokens and enable us to engage with them, but without legal legitimacy, this instrument will not work.

there is still work to do to legally ground the personal token. consider helping. current spec: [PERSONAL TOKEN v0.1](/PERSONAL_TOKEN).

## a world that supports explorations

with personal tokens, we can support bolder, riskier explorations. 

the kind of explorations that would lead us to discover many profound ideas.

most of us cannot follow our natural curiosities because we cannot incentivize the support needed to follow them. our world is full of einsteins, curies, kurosawas that are confined to spending just a couple hours a day following their hearts and the rest of their lives doing work they're not meant to do.

we cannot fathom how big of a loss this is to all of us.

we will only realize in hindsight once we enable people to explore freely and revel in the brilliance of their discoveries.

## a new primitive

the personal token is a new primitive that unlocks a powerful new financial system that i believe will change our world for the better...
