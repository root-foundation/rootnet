title: we can't incentivize help
caption: for hard explorations. for life itself.

we have a robust system to allocate talent, attention, and capital towards ideas - through _companies_.

but we have nothing to allocate the same for explorations.

as a result, we all lose out far more than we can imagine.

let me show you this problem through my lens:

## explorations are hard

towards the end of 2023, i saw ai do something that shook my beliefs about our world. i dropped everything and started an open-ended exploration to understand how ai would change our world.

this exploration has been the most difficult thing i've done.

for almost a year i had no lasting sense of clarity about almost anything. i woke up every day confronting ambiguity. directions the felt promising quickly turned out to be dead ends. i ran through my savings. i missed having a north star, a sense of direction, and being able to measure progress.

but even as my mind settled, i was intimidated by the sheer complexity of our world that i needed to understand, quickly.

i cannot explore alone. i need help. a lot of it.

## but i can't _incentivize_ help

i asked and received help from many people. i'm grateful. but as a previous startup founder, i knew the kind of help i wanted: deeply committed, serious, intense. the kind of help that doing really difficult things requires.

but i couldn't _incentivize_ help! i had no way to give people a stake in my success on this journey. i couldn't just start a "company" for an exploration that i wasn't even sure would lead to a company anytime soon, if ever!

as a result, i've progressed on this exploration far slower than i would have liked.

## i'm not alone

there are many suppressed minds in our world. 

there are many people who cannot follow their curiosities because they cannot incentivize the help and support they need.

we have lost, and continue to lose, many explorations that would profoundly change our world for the better. a lose-lose situation.

we need to fix this.
