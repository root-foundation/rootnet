title: we can't incentivize help
caption: for explorations. for life itself.

we have a robust system to allocate talent, attention, and capital towards ideas - through _companies_, but we have nothing to allocate the same for explorations.

as a result, we all lose out far more than we can imagine.

let me show you this problem through my lens:

towards the end of 2023, i saw ai do something that shook my beliefs about our world. i dropped everything and started an open-ended exploration to understand how our world will change.

this exploration has been the most difficult thing i've done.

through this experience, i've learned that i cannot explore effectively alone. i need help. a lot of it.

**but i can't _incentivize_ help!**

i've asked and received help from many people. i'm grateful. 

but as a previous startup founder, i knew the kind of help i wanted: deeply committed, serious, intense. the kind of help that doing really difficult things requires.

but i cant _incentivize_ help! i have no way to give people a stake in my success on this journey. i can't start a "company" for an exploration that i'm not even sure would lead to a company anytime soon, if ever!

as a result, i've progressed on this exploration far slower than i would have liked.

**i'm not alone.**

in the same way we would not be able to get great ideas off the ground without being able to share equity in it (through the notion of a company), 

we cannot get many profound explorations off the ground. there are many people who cannot follow their curiosities because they cannot incentivize the help and support they need to get started.

we have lost, and continue to lose, many explorations that would lead to incredible ideas that would change our world. we will only be able to see this in hindsight.

this is a lose-lose situation.

let's fix this.
