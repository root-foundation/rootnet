title: how do we value potential?
---
> (this is unpublished early draft).

through this story we've encountered instruments that have valuations based on their potential - companies, personal tokens, network tokens, humanity's token.

valuing potential well is perhaps the most valuable (and most difficult) skill.

let's study what it means to value potential at a more fundamental level, that applies to all of the instruments we've covered in this story so far, and to other kinds of tokens we will invent.
## an art

to say that we can calculate potential is like saying we can calculate how our world will evolve. it is nearly impossible to do it perfectly, or even well. most of what we believe will be the future will likely be wrong. we don't have the compute to calculate all the possibilities.

which is why i see valuing potential as an art. and like arts, it requires skill.

## different levels

- different time horizons.

## difficult

- becoming exponentially more difficult the faster our world changes.
