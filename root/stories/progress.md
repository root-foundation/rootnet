progress:
- freedom
- more people
- education
- abundance
- growth
- safety
- sufficient health (immortality is anti-progress. i'm confident the market will correct for this, especially as young people become more powerful than old people, and as they increasingly find many old people getting in the way of progress with their outdated minds. i'm not sure what the right number is, but i feel our current lifespan 80 - 100 years is probably the best, assuming all of those years are healthy, active. i do not support the quest for immortality).

these are all levers for the same underlying phenomenon. improving any one will improve the rest. increase safety, you gain freedom, you gain abundance, you gain growth, you gain more people, you gain everything.
