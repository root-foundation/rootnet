title: better culture
---

incentives shape culture.

we can derive the new culture based on these incentives.

## grounded optimism

we would be incentivized to believe we can do great things, while also adapting to reality - because otherwise our personal token valuations will fall as we won't be able to actually create value.

## help

we would be incentivized to help others realize their potential because by doing so we join in on their success (by joining their cap tables). most of us will create most of our wealth this way.

## collaboration

we would be incentivized to rise with others because the more creative and complex our work becomes as a result of ai, the more help we will need in order to make meaningful progress. this will be further reinforced as we will see that the wealthiest people will also have the most diluted personal token cap tables.

## growth

we would be incentivized to grow. as we fix our markets by implementing and iterating on these new instruments, the more our growth will be the good kind, not the cancerous kind.

in nature, there is only accelerating growth or accelerating decay. incentivizing growth is a good thing.

## unity

words, summits, conferences, agreements, handshakes don't lead to lasting unity. incentives do.

we would be incentivized to stand united against our shared problems to increase the value of humanity's token.

this culture is aligned with reality. reality contains many possibilities for us to solve our problems, that grounded optimism enables us to seek. i think pessimism is a delusion because it blinds us to the many possibilities that exist in reality.

and this is not a new culture, we can see early glimpses of this new culture in the startup community in san francisco because they have already been shaped by the positive-sum incentives that high growth startups have enabled.

we will feel such a culture far more deeply, because this tokenized system incentivizes it much more strongly. and we will feel this culture much more broadly: everywhere and in everything that we do, not just narrowly focused to technology and startups (as ai enables extreme outcomes everywhere and we securitize all of our expressions).
