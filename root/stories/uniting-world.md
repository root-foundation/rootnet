## token for humanity

let's say we have a token that represents humanity's collective potential.

humanity's token would hold equity in all other tokens (personal, network, company, etc.) through a sort of "equity fee" for participating in our world.

humanity's token would be grounded in reality - because all of the tokens it holds equity in are grounded in reality. if we don't see profits generated proportional to our belief in humanity's token, we would value it less.

the value of humanity's token will be worth far far more than the sum of the equities of all of our tokens because it factors the potential of our species itself - **all the value we will ever create**. 

in other words, humanity token's valuation captures the value that our unborn descendants will create, in the same way that a company's valuation today captures the value that not-yet-hired employees will create for the company.

humanity' token's valuation will likely start at an order of magnitude greater than the sum of valuations of all tokens. and this gap will increase as we gain more confidence in the system and in ourselves.

humanity's token would enable us to value our potential, our future, in ways that we cannot today. our stock markets only reflect maybe a decade or so into the future because we are confined to low abstraction instruments: companies.

as we saw, personal tokens will likely have a longer growth time horizon than companies (multiple decades). and network tokens even longer (as they are grounded in personal tokens). which means, humanity's token will represents the longest time horizon - many decades into our future.

## universal basic equity

and let's say we periodically issue new shares of humanity's token to each person as a sort of *universal basic equity*.

what would happen?

## we would rise together

how?

firstly, our baseline will rise significantly as each person will hold equity in the potential of all of humanity through shares in humanity's token. as long as we believe tomorrow will be better than today, these shares will be worth a lot, and appreciate a lot.

we will want those with the greatest potential to [reinvest their personal token dividends](/designing-personal-token#reinvesting-dividends) back into themselves to further fuel their growth - which directly grows our own wealth (through our equity in humanity's token that holds equity in them). 

which means that as long as the individual has potential to create value, the individual will not pay taxes of any kind. importantly, this isn't "redistribution" of wealth. this is an entirely different mechanism. individuals don't have to "give back" to society - society grows with them by holding equity in their success.

zero sum -> positive sum.

when people are in decay - i.e, when their cap table (which includes us) feels that they no longer have potential to create value - we will vote for their future capital gains to be distributed to their cap table (which includes us). 

like companies, i believe that the most successful individuals will also be the most diluted - because the higher you want to rise, the more help you need from others. which means when the most successful people die, most of their wealth will be distributed to others (cap table) rather than hoarded by their descendants.

critically, this system doesn't cause inflation because people are strongly incentivized to **hold** their equity in humanity's token because it will appreciate greatly as long as we believe the future will be better than the present. 

we would only have inflation in the phases we lose hope because that's when everyone will try to dump their shares of humanity's token into the market.

this system preserves individual agency. wealth rises in each person's hand without some authority deciding how it's spent before it even reaches them.

individual and collective prosperity become intertwined.

in such a world, we will celebrate any effort that increases the value of humanity's token. scientific breakthroughs. medical breakthroughs. improved safety. art that inspires hope that is grounded in reality.

**in such a world, we would be on the same side.**

## unity through incentives

incentives > words.

no number of summits, conferences, treaties, etc. will lead to lasting peace and successful collaboration to fix our shared global challenges (like global warming).

this system gives creates strong financial incentives to be united and fight against our shared problems together - which is the only way we can ever solve them.
