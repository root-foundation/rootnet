## token for humanity

let's scale this to the world. let's say we have a token that represents humanity's collective potential that holds equity in each of our personal tokens (as a sort of "equity fee" for participating in our world).

the value of humanity's token will be worth far far more than the sum of the equities of all of our personal tokens because it factors the potential of our species itself - *all the value we will ever create*.

and since humanity's token is a network token, it would be grounded in reality. 

if we do not see the profits generated in our world in the way we hoped they would (reflected in valuations of personal, network and humanity's token), we would start to short humanity's token.

## universal basic equity

and let's say we periodically issue new shares of humanity's token to each person as a sort of universal basic equity.

what would our world feel like?

## we would rise together

how?

firstly, our baseline will rise significantly as each person will hold equity in the potential of all of humanity through shares in humanity's token. as long as we believe tomorrow will be much better than today, these shares will be worth a lot, and appreciate a lot. and new shares will be issues periodically.

we will want those with the greatest potential to reinvest their personal token dividends back into themselves to further fuel their growth - which directly grows our own wealth (through our equity in humanity's token that holds equity in them). which means that as long as the individual works towards collective prosperity, the individual gives nothing up. (i.e, no "taxes" of any kind)

when people are in decay - i.e, when their cap table (which includes us) feels that they no longer have potential to create value - we will vote for their future capital gains to be distributed to their cap table (which includes us). 

and like companies, i believe that the most successful individuals will also be the most diluted - because the higher you want to rise, the more help you need from others. which means when the most successful people die, most of their wealth will be distributed to others (cap table) rather than hoarded by their descendants.

this system doesn't cause inflation because people are strongly incentivized to *hold* their equity in humanity's token as long as we collectively believe tomorrow will be better than today. we would only have inflation in the phases we lose hope (i.e, when everyone tries to dump their shares of humanity's token into the market).

this system preserves individual agency. wealth rises in each person's hand without some authority deciding how it's spent before it even reaches them.

individual and collective prosperity become intertwined.
