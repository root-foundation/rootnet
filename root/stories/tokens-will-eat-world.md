title: tokens will eat the world
---

as ai makes outcomes extreme, we will securitize everything we do.

a security is a shared structure that lets many people coordinate around something uncertain. 

the simplest example is a company. a company isn’t just a product or a team - it’s a structure that lets us pool talent, attention, and capital toward something that doesn’t fully exist yet.

once we wrap something in a security, we can:
- allocate resources to it.
- share upside from its success.
- and adapt quickly as reality changes. 

securities exist at different levels of abstraction. the personal token exists at a higher level of abstraction than a company because it is grounded in equities in companies. similarly, we will cover another security later that sits above personal tokens.

and as ai pushes our work into more creative & complex territory that have far more extreme outcomes, we’ll securitize every expression, at all levels of abstraction.

we will have tokens for everything.

the more creative and complex our work becomes, the more outcomes become extreme, the more we securitize our world, the more broadly personal tokens will be used.

in the early days, personal tokens will be primarily used by those in the "startup" world - those who want to get involved with companies by starting, working at, or investing in them - because personal tokens are grounded in equities in companies.

eventually we will see everyone - artists, creators, musicians, scientists, politicians, etc. - all use personal tokens to incentivize help, because personal tokens will be grounded in every expression that has extreme outcomes (to capture a person's upside).
