title: tokens will eat the world
---
to understand why, we need to first study how our world will change.

## artificial intelligence

artificial intelligence is a tool that enables us to better express ourselves.

as ai improves, we will naturally gravitate towards more creative and complex work - across the board - because ai will do the simpler, less creative work for us.

## extreme outcomes

but the more creative and complex our work becomes, the more extreme outcomes we will see:

at any given moment, a tiny (and shrinking) percentage of people, companies, networks - will be responsible for the majority of value created. (i.e, power law distribution of outcomes).

creative, complex work and extreme outcomes go hand in hand. we can't have one without the other. which is why we already see extreme outcomes in highly creative, complex work (startups, content creation, arts, science, etc.).

what will be new is extreme outcomes across the board, because ai will do the simpler work across the board. ai doesn't distinguish between domains and labels like we do. it doesn't care if the task in "music" or "programming" or anything. all ai cares about complexity.

extreme outcomes just represents what most of us intuitively know: for any creative activity, there exist people that are just way better than the rest.

**extreme outcomes is natural.**

## dynamism

extreme outcomes on its own paints a sort of dystopian picture.

if ai makes outcomes more extreme, will that lead to a world with like... 10 people who create all the value and no one else can?

absolutely not.

we fail to see what extreme outcomes means without also seeing that it also brings _dynamism_:

---

**1) peak outcome skyrockets.** 

the most valuable companies today are worth much more than the most value companies a few decades ago. as ai improves, we will see peak outcomes skyrocket much faster than ever before. 

what this means is that even "smaller" wins still feel big. a multi-millionaire can afford a lot in our world today even though their share relative to the richest people is falling sharply. and we have many more millionaires today than ever before. **we will have many more winners than ever before**.

---

**2) the rate of displacement of winners increases.**

the top companies today are more fragile than ever before because of a breakthrough (llms) that has fundamentally changed our world, which they can't adapt to.

as ai improves, the rate of such breakthroughs will increase. increasingly, breakthroughs from unpredictable areas will shake up our world. existing winners will find it very difficult to hold onto their positions.

---

this is what a _dynamic_ world with extreme outcomes looks like. i believe we will see a world in which ideas will generate trillions in revenue days after being launched, and become outcompeted within months because of some random breakthrough elsewhere that invalidated their approach entirely.

it is a world in which we react to a rapidly changing reality blazingly fast.

such dynamism is key for our progress.

and with the right financial system, such a world benefits all of us.

extreme outcomes _without_ dynamism points at a rotten system: unfairness. oppression. favoritism. political influence. we should be very suspicious when we see stagnation in the system. stagnation is unnatural.

## we will securitize everything

as ai makes outcomes extreme for most of our activities, we will securitize everything we do.

a security is a shared structure that lets many people coordinate around something uncertain. the simplest example is a company. a company isn’t just a product or a team - it’s a structure that lets us pool talent, attention, and capital toward something that doesn’t fully exist yet.

once we wrap something in a security, we can:
- allocate resources to it.
- share upside from its success.
- and adapt quickly as reality changes. 

securities exist at different levels of abstraction. the personal token exists at a higher level of abstraction than a company because it is grounded in equities in companies. similarly, we will cover another security later that sits above personal tokens.

and as ai pushes our work into more creative & complex territory that have far more extreme outcomes, we’ll securitize every expression, at all levels of abstraction, because a security is the best way to share upside in things that exhibit extreme outcomes.

we will have tokens for everything.

## personal tokens will be used broadly

the more we securitize our world, the more broadly personal tokens will be used.

in the early days, personal tokens will be primarily used by those in the "startup" world - those who want to get involved with companies by starting, working at, or investing in them - because personal tokens are grounded in equities in companies.

but as we securitize our world, we will see everyone - artists, creators, musicians, scientists, politicians, etc. - leverage personal tokens to incentivize help, because personal tokens will be grounded in every expression that has extreme outcomes (all kinds of tokens for all sorts of expressions, not just "technology companies").

## we won't be able to rely on debt

debt requires predictability: we have to pay it back on a fixed schedule, with interest.

our world runs on debt. from mortgages, student loans, credit cards, everything is structured with debt.

but the more creative and complex our work becomes, the more unpredictable it becomes. that's why startup founders and content creators rarely get started on debt. it doesn't make sense for such a risky endeavor.

in order to move away from debt, we will use personal tokens to raise venture capital to finance our lives.

but personal tokens are not enough. what happens for those of us who the world doesn't (yet) see potential in? we won't be able to incentivize help even though we will need it more than ever before. 

this is why we need an entirely new financial system for a post ai world. we need another primitive. and a profound design pattern that enables us to rise together in the age of ai.
