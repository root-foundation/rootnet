## accelerating psychosis

ai accelerates the rate of change of our world, exponentially. as a result, all of our systems are rapidly losing touch with reality. 

our education curriculums have become useless. our political system can't shape policy fast enough to keep up with ai. our courts are struggling to interpret the many new legal challenges that are cropping up faster than ever. our debt based economic system is already crushing millions of new grads who are failing to get jobs due to extreme outcomes.

disconnection from reality (psychosis) leads to suffering.

an interesting feature of nature is that there is no direct way to grab peace. we only achieve peace by grounding ourselves in reality. the more disconnected from reality we are, the further we are from peace. 

the further our education system is from what actually matters in our world, the more we suffer. 

the further our doctors' advice is from what actually leads to health, the more we suffer.

the further our politicians' actions are from what we actually want, the more we suffer.

our world is far from reality. and it's only getting further as things are changing much faster.

## what is real?

that which is, whether or not we acknowledge or believe it.

for example: in this moment, there is a **best** education curriculum that would enable us to learn what we need to in order to thrive in our world and live better lives.

we may disagree on what it is. maybe none of us even know what it is. but it exists in reality whether we like it or not. if we all choose an inferior curriculum, then we all suffer as a result.

## reality is constantly changing

reality changes every moment. 

the best curriculum in this moment may not be the best in the next moment as a consequence of some change in the world. 

maybe a new scientific breakthrough or cultural shift has invalidated some aspect of the current best curriculum, making another learning approach objectively better.

therefore, aligning our world to reality isn't about figuring any specific thing out, because what we believe to be true can become outdated very quickly.

**aligning with reality is a continuous, moment-to-moment, process.**

therefore, we need a **system** that enables us to continuously, effectively, **seek** what is real and true.

## collectively seeking truth

we are all part of the same organism. this means that we have access to a *collective* intelligence that far surpasses any of our individual intelligences.

when what we believe to be true is invalidated by some change, often, a few of us sense this change. they study it. they tell others about it. they act on it. as others understand this new truth through them, they update their own beliefs that must adapt as a consequence of this change, and spread it further. in this way our knowledge cascades throughout the world. a ripple effect.

the better and faster we can surface and spread new truths about our world the better we can align ourselves with reality.

the best tool we have to collectively seek truth is free markets - a space in which we can express ourselves freely through any medium: ideas, capital, etc.

but free markets only work when we can actually express what we value! and today, we can't express what we actually value. our markets largely don't reflect what we actually care about.

we need to fix this.
