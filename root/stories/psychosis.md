## accelerating psychosis

ai exponentially accelerates the rate of change of our world. 

as a result, all of our systems are rapidly losing touch with reality. our education curriculums have become useless. our political system can't shape policy fast enough to keep up with ai. our courts are struggling to interpret the many new legal challenges that are cropping up faster than ever. our debt based economic system is already crushing millions of new grads who are failing to get jobs due to extreme outcomes (i.e., no opportunities for average, infinitely many for the best).

our world is rapidly losing touch with reality and as a result many of us will suffer greatly. since we are part of the same organism, *all of us will suffer greatly*.

we need to get a grip on reality.

## what is real?

that which is, whether or not we acknowledge or believe it.

for example, for the world today there is a "best" education curriculum that would enable us to learn what we need to thrive in the world and live better lives. we may not find it. we may delude ourselves into thinking something else is the best even though it's not. as a result we suffer.

misalignment with reality leads to suffering.

reality changes every moment. what is the best curriculum right now may not be the best in the next moment as a consequence of some change in the world. maybe a new scientific breakthrough or cultural shift has invalidated some aspect of the current best curriculum, making another learning approach objectively better.

therefore, aligning our world to reality isn't doing any single thing, but rather a continuous process. we need a *system* that enables us to continuously *seek* what is real and true.

## collective intelligence

we are all part of the same organism. this means that we have access to a *collective* intelligence that far surpasses any of our individual intelligences.

when what we believe to be true is invalidated by some change, often, a few of us sense this change. they study it. they tell others about it. they act on it. as others understand this new truth through them, they update their own beliefs that must adapt as a consequence of this change, and spread it further. in this way our knowledge cascades throughout the world. a ripple effect.

the better and faster we can surface and spread new truths about our world the better we can align ourselves with reality.

we can do this by allocating resources to what we value. each of us values differently as a result of our unique makeup, experiences, etc. in fact, the more freely we think, and the more we embrace what makes us unique, the better our collective intelligence becomes at aligning us with reality - in the same way that a more diverse gut bacteria culture results in healthier bodies.
