title: Personal Token — Issuance Brief (Draft)
toc: true
---

> **Status:** Draft for discussion only. Not legal advice. Not for execution.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Brief

This document is intended to orient legal counsel quickly and precisely to a proposed issuance of a personal token.

The goal is to minimize invention and maximize validation. The core economic design, legal instrument, and intended compliance posture have already been drafted. Counsel is asked to review, correct, adapt, and finalize—not redesign—the system.

---

## 2. Issuer Overview

- **Issuer:** Individual (natural person)
- **Location:** San Francisco, California
- **Status:** Early-stage; no prior personal token issuance

The issuer is not forming a company for this issuance. The personal token is issued directly by the individual under a standalone legal instrument.

---

## 3. Description of the Instrument

The instrument being issued is a **personal token**, as defined in the accompanying documents:

- **Personal Token Specification** — economic intent and scope
- **Personal Token Legal Instrument (v0.1)** — enforceable rights and obligations

In brief:

- Shares represent proportional participation in the issuer’s **realized cash capital gains**, as defined.
- Shares confer no control, governance, employment, or agency rights.
- Shareholders collectively control one economic decision only: reinvest vs distribute realized gains.

The instrument is expected to be treated as a security.

---

## 4. Intended Issuance Context

- **Initial participants:** ~10 known individuals
- **Relationship:** Known personally or professionally to the issuer
- **Consideration:** Cash or cash equivalents
- **Marketing:** No public solicitation; private discussions only

The issuer’s intent is to establish a reusable structure that can support future issuances, not a one-off or symbolic transaction.

---

## 5. Intended Compliance Posture (High Level)

The issuer expects the issuance to rely on an exemption from registration under U.S. securities law, rather than full SEC registration.

The issuer is not pursuing:

- Public offerings
- Retail crowdfunding
- Broad solicitation to unknown participants

The accompanying document **Personal Token Issuance & Compliance (US, v0.1)** outlines the intended framing and constraints.

Counsel is asked to:

- Confirm whether this posture is viable
- Identify the most appropriate exemption pathway
- Flag any mismatches between intent and regulatory reality

---

## 6. Documents Expected to Be Involved

The issuer anticipates a document stack that includes:

- The Personal Token Legal Instrument (to be reviewed and adapted)
- A purchase or subscription agreement
- Participant representations and warranties
- Risk disclosures and acknowledgements

Illustrative drafts and skeletons are included below for discussion purposes only.

---

## 7. Open Questions for Counsel

The issuer would like counsel’s input on the following:

- Whether the proposed legal instrument is internally coherent and enforceable
- Whether the intended issuance context aligns with available exemptions
- What additional disclosures or representations are required
- What filings or notices are required, and when
- What aspects of the design introduce unnecessary risk or friction

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Goals

The issuer is not asking counsel to:

- Redesign the economic primitive
- Propose alternative business models
- Optimize for public market compatibility at this stage

The priority is correctness, defensibility, and reuse.

---

## 9. Next Steps

If the structure is viable, the issuer intends to:

- Finalize execution-ready documents with counsel
- Complete required filings and notices
- Proceed with an initial private issuance

All execution will occur only after legal review and approval.
