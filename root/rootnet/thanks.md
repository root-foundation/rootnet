firstly i want to thank nature. 

nature teaches us what we need to do. the best systems mimic nature in a fundamental way. anything that i've expressed that is misaligned with nature is due to my own delusions. anything that works does so simply because it's aligned with nature. "authorship" is a delusion.

i also want to thank to my brothers:

[gautam](https://gautamtata.com) - who has supported me in more ways than i can explain. i wouldn't have been able to explore rootnet without his support and feedback.

[shiv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNUGEccAAAAJ) - this idea emerged through many discussions we've had for over a year now. at this point it's not really possible to say who contributed what. this collaboration is a testament that we can see and do more *together* than we can alone. that working together is not just summing the parts, but much more.

i also want to thank the many who engaged with me and this idea over the months.
